# TERMINAL GRAPH SOLVER

Terminal Graph Solver is a command-line application designed to solve classic graph problems. It provides a simple interface to load graph instances and apply well-known algorithms.

## Features

This app can solve four types of graph problems: 
- Minimum spanning tree using Prim's algorithm;
- Single-source shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm;
- All-pairs shortest paths using Floyd-Warshall algorithm;
- Maximum flow between source and destination using Ford-Fulkerson algorithm.

## Graph file format

Graph instances are stored in the ```instances/``` directory. Each file must follow a specific format:

```
NAME: graph_name
n: number of vertices/nodes
m: number of edges
first_node<TAB>second_node<TAB>cost.
```
> Be careful when creating new filesâ€”incorrect formatting may cause parsing errors.
> You might consider switching to CSV format for easier data handling and compatibility.

## Building with CMake

The project uses CMake to ensure cross-platform compatibility and simplify the build process on both Linux and Windows.

### Linux 

1. Open a terminal in the project root directory
2. Create a build directory:
   ```
   mkdir build && cd build
   ```
3. Generate build files with CMake:
   ```
   cmake ..
   ```
4. Compile the project:
   ```
   cmake --build .
   ```
> Tested on Ubuntu 24.04+. Make sure you have ```g++``` and ```cmake``` installed.

### Windows (Visual Studio)

1. Open CMake GUI or use the terminal.
2. Set the source directory to the project root.
3. Set the build directory (e.g., ```build/```).
4. Click Configure, select your version of Visual Studio.
5. Click Generate, then Open Project.
6. Build the solution in Visual Studio.

### Windows (MinGW)

If you prefer using MinGW from the terminal:
```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ..
cmake --build .
```
> Make sure ```mingw32-make``` is installed and available in your system PATH.

## Future improvements

Here are some ideas to enhance the application:

- Add graphical visualization of graphs using a C++ graphics library
- Support alternative input formats like CSV
